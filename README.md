# Web-Design-Assignment-2
I was unable to get the Marquee to be able to stop scrolling when hovering over it and was unable to get the transparent box to hover over lebron correctly. I have the code I was attempting to use to do both of these features inside my code but I am just not sure why it wasnt working.
